AIR AIRBUS A320 AIRCRAFT VTWGJ AT BANGALORE ON 01092018 10 FACTUAL INFORMATION 11 History of Flight On 1st September 2018 Airbus A320 aircraft VTWGJ was involved in a serious incident while operating flight G8283 from Bangalore to Pune The aircraft was under command of an ATPL holder PF with a CPL holder acting as Pilot Monitoring PM There were 169 passengers on board The incident occurred in day light conditions There was no fire or any injury to crew or passengers During takeoff roll engine no 1 N2 vibrations went very high at a ground speed of 20 knots The vibrations levels increased to 100 units and at 1500 radio altitude alert on ECAM Master Caution came up for high engine vibrations on engine 1 and hence the QRH procedure was carried out after which the N2 vibrations parameters were at normal levels momentarily The vibrations levels increased again followed by other warnings ie Eng 1 OIL CLOG Eng 1 OIL FILTER DEGRADE Eng 1 STALL In addition AUTO FLT AUTO THR was put OFF and a decision was taken by the commander to continue on manual thrust The warnings were followed by Eng 1 FAIL The ECAM procedure to shut down Eng 1 was carried out The PF decided to return to VOBL nearest airport on priority and a PAN PAN call was made No assistance at the airport was requested A single engine straight in ILS approach was carried out Following instructions of the PF the PM had switched off the Glideslope mode During final approach several callouts were made by the PM with regards to speed and alignment of the aircraft PF accordingly carried out small adjustments of eng 2 thrust During approach in an attempt to flare attitude was raised The aircraft pitched up accordingly but limited by the aircraft protection αprot which had been activated and touched the ground As per PM he was aware that it 2 had resulted in hard landing but he had not conveyed it to PF The aircraft taxied to bay On ground it was found that the g value at touchdown has reached 268 whereas the Manufacturer limitation is 26 DFDR output was provided to the manufacturer and computation of landing gʼ based on parameters ie Landing g landing weight of the aircraft 6445T and Rate of Descent at Touch down 131 feetsec gave a value of 325 classifying the event as a Severe Hard Landing  The occurrence was hence categorised as severe hard landing The aircraft remained on ground for almost 6 months for maintenance activity 12 Injuries to Person INJURIES CREW PASSENGERS OTHERS FATAL Nil Nil Nil SERIOUS Nil Nil Nil MINOR NONE Nil  06 Nil  169 Nil 13 Damage to Aircraft The DFDR data of the

November 2017 and is equipped with P  W Neo Engines At the time of occurrence this Aircraft had logged 3096 hrs and 1969 cycles since new 161 Operational Aspects Following are the relevant extracts from FCOM QRH  With ATHR engaged when a thrust lever is set below the CL detent the thrust of the associated engine is limited to the thrust lever position Normal operation of the ATHR system requires the thrust levers to be  In the CL detent for the twoengine configuration  If they are not set in the CL detent LVR CLB flashes white on the FMA If one lever is in the CL detent and other one is not then LVR ASYM is displayed in amber  TL of operating engine in MCT detent when in the oneengineout configuration one TL at idle is considered one engine operation  If the appropriate lever is not set in the MCT detent LVR MCT flashes white on the FMA 5 High engine vibration requires the flight crew to monitor engine parameters especially the EGT and cross check with the other engine Thrust can be reduced if conditions permit to do so in order to maintain vibrations below the amber threshold of 5 UNITS The ENG SD page is automatically displayed between 1st engine takeoff thrust and till 1500 ft RA The relevant SD page is automatically displayed as soon as a fault or malfunction triggers a caution or warning message When the cockpit unit Units value of vibrations exceeds 5 Units the Units values on the Engine SD page change from GREEN to AMBER The high vibration ECAM caution is inhibited below 1500ft RA The maximum level of vibration that can be recorded on the DFDR is 10UNITS 6 As per stall procedure whenever engine stall In flight is detected by Flight Crew before FADEC or instructed by ECAM the thrust lever of the affected engine should be set to idle When one engine TL is at idle it is considered as single engine operation and the other engine thrust lever at that time should be set to MCT The ECAM caution THR LEVERSMOVE would be displayed and in addition the FMA will display LEVER MCT flashing in white A master caution is repeated every 5 seconds if one lever is at idle and the other is not at the MCT detent When the AP is in OP DES mode it manages the aircraft trajectory to target the selected CAS but the aircraft trajectory can only be level flight or descent 7 ENG1 FAIL ECAM caution is triggered when the engine core speed falls below idle whereas ENG SHUTDOWN is triggered when the engine Master Switch is set to OFF by the flight crew As per the FCTM in the event of an engine failure thrust levers should be set to MCT The stabilization criterion is given below This requires that the flight crew must initiate a Go Around if approach is not stabilized 8 Following is the Normal Standard Operating Procedures Approach given in FCOM 9 10 17

Investigation Technique NIL 16 2 ANALYSIS 21 GENERAL Both operating flight crew were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight Their preflight Medical was valid They had undergone all refresher trainings and nothing was wanting as per the requirements The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness Airworthiness Review Certificate at the time of incident The aircraft held valid Certificate of Release to Service The mandatory Modifications and SBs were complied with The weather at the airport at the time of incident was fine and is not a contributory factor to the incident 22 ENGINEERING LOAD ANALYSIS The reason for engine parameters going beyond limits during flight and resultant In Flight Shut Down was because of No 3 Bearing Failure This is a known problem with Neo Engines The initial review of the DFDR data plots indicated a max vertical acceleration of 268 g g values is sampled 8 times a second Vertical g is sampled 8 times per second in the DFDR readout and the peak value may not have been captured if it occurred between 2 recorded values  DFDR raw data was shared with Airbus who carried out loads computation in order to assess the severity of the event The feedback was received wherein it was indicated that though the touchdown gʼ was 268 but computation of landing gʼ based on parameters ie Landing g landing weight of the aircraft 6445T and Rate of Descent at Touch down 131 feetsec gave a value of 325 classifying the event as a Severe Hard Landing Airbus has introduced new FDIMU software incorporating a new load 15 report which analyses additional parameters to the ones used in the existing software With the application of the new software the load 15 report will directly classify similar events as a Severe Hard Landing 17 As far as severe hard landing is concerned the aircraft or maintenance aspects have not contributed to the incident 23 DFDR Analysis The aircraft returned to Bangalore due to high vibrations followed by Inflight Engine Shut Down IFSD in Flight The aircraft is fitted with P  W Neo engines and the engine vibration is a known issue A DFDR analysis report was received from Airbus and has been used while analyzing the operational aspects of this occurrence 231 High Engine Vibrations  ATB During takeoff roll at a ground speed of 20 knots Eng  1 N2 Vibrations reached 100 Units The other engine was operating normal with all parameters stable Auto pilot was engaged in SRS NAV mode when the aircraft was at 200 ft radio altitude with CAS as 164 knots The N2 vibrations of 100 Units continued The engine SD page got displayed and N2 vibrations flashed number of times during the above period Though ENG 1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution was recorded as per ACARS the caution is inhibited until 1500 ft RA At that time EGT on engine  1 was 940C and on engine  2 it was 890 C The caution was displayed above 1500ft RA The aircraft continued to climb and while crossing 5000 ft with AP1 and ATHR engaged vibrations were still 100 Units Eng  1 thrust lever was moved back but the Eng  1 N2 vibrations continued to be 100 Units The crew continued the flight with CAS of 225 knots After crossing 5500 feet altitude was selected to 14000 feet Both thrust levers remained in CL detent with auto thrust active Engine  1 N2 Vibrations continued at 100 UNITS While crossing 8500 feet with AP1 and auto thrust still engaged Eng  1 thrust lever was reduced to 9 degrees Eng 1 N2 vibrations dropped from 100 Units to 50 Units When the aircraft was climbing through 10000 feet Eng  1 thrust lever was moved from 9 degrees to 11 degrees Correspondingly N2 vibrations 18 also started increasing and went beyond 50 Units Auto Pilot 1 and Auto thrust were still engaged Eng  1 N2 vibrations further increased to 68 Units which triggered the master caution warning twice The Eng  1 N2 vibrations reached 100 Units with engine stall This caused the master caution second time The aircraft still continued to climb with Eng  1 thrust lever moved to idle and Eng  2 thrust lever in CL detent This triggered the master caution every 5 seconds to alert the crew that autothrust is limited and to move the thrust levers Auto thrust was disengaged when the aircraft was crossing 12900 feet which stopped the master caution Auto pilot 1 remained engaged The crew decided to return and auto pilot was changed to OP DES mode when the aircraft was at 14000 feet The selected altitude was reduced to 12000 feet and selected CAS was increased to 250 knots from 214 knots There was no change in thrust lever positions engine 1 TL remained at idle and engine 2 TL remained in CL detent delivering climb power After about 84 seconds of initiation of turn back Engine 1 oil filter degraded and filter clog messages were recorded on the ACARS report The ENG page was displayed on the SD As engine 2 was at climb power and engine 1 was at idle the aircraft energy was too high The Autopilot was unable to maintain the 250 kts selected speed even in level flight since Auto thrust was OFF and speed increased beyond 260 kts By reducing the thrust on engine 2 the AP was able to meet the selected CAS target and increase the aircraft descent rate towards the selected altitude After 30 seconds of reducing thrust on Eng  2 engine fail ECAM caution got triggered with Eng  1 EGT increasing from 610 degree C to 1095 degree C The flight crew shut down Eng 1 by taking Engine 1 lever to OFF The thrust levers were not moved as required in the FCOM Engine 1 TL remained at idle 19 and engine 2 TL remained at 16 intermediate position between idle and CL for a minute When the aircraft was at 6700 ft and descending to selected altitude of 5500 ft speed was at selected CAS of 220 kts ATHR remained OFF Both TLs were at idle With both APs engaged LOC capture mode got engaged LOC TRK mode got engaged a minute later indicating that LOC is captured and was tracked During this period Glideslope mode was engaged and captured 232 Approach  Landing The aircraft had touched down at 005108 hrs UTC During approach at 004931 hrs UTC aircraft was in CONF FULL Slats Flaps 2740 Landing gear was selected down Ground spoilers were armed Auto brake was not armed and AP1  2 were engaged At 1120 ft RA the aircraft was tracking the GS and LOC ATHR was disengaged with both TLs at idle CAS was 135 kts reducing Aircraft pitch was 35º increasing At 004937 when the aircraft was at 1000 ft RA decreasing AP 1  2 was disconnected by the flight crew CAS was 125 kts Both FDs were engaged in GS LOC modes and the aircraft was aligned to the glide slope and localiser 20 PF carried out manual approach Between 1000 ft to 400 ft RA high activity was recorded on Pilot Flying side stick Pitch varied between 3º and 12º nose up and Roll varied between 0º and 10º right wing down Vertical descent rate varied between 0 ft min and 1600 ft min CAS varied between 125 kts and 113 kts VLS was 127 kts During this period low energy aural warning SPEED SPEED SPEED triggered 4 times Thrust was manually increased on engine 2 Aircraft started to dip under the glide slope by 14 dots and EGPWS aural warning GLIDESLOPE was triggered at 620 ft RA for 14 seconds Glideslope deviation reached 27 dots below glide slope at 400 ft RA Alpha protection was activated 6 times AoA reached 12º Alpha Prot and 15º Alpha Max The approach was continued despite the aircraft being unstable in attitude below the glideslope by 27 dots and its speed below VLS In accordance with the FCOM stabilisation criteria a goaround should have been performed 21 When the aircraft was at 400 ft RA engine  2 thrust was controlled manually between idle and CL detents At 250 ft RA engine  2 TL was progressively reduced reached to IDLE detent at 200 ft RA then moved to the CL detent before being set at IDLE detent again at 40 ft RA Pitch increased from 5º to 10º nose up CAS reduced from 130 kts to 110 kts at landing VLS 17kts Roll varied between 6º right wing down and 2º left wing down Flare was performed while full back stick order was applied Alpha Prot was active AoA increased from 128 to 157  AoA max Alpha Prot limited the AoA from increasing further At the time of touch down CAS was 109 kts VLS 18kts vertical descent rate was 752 ft min recorded VRTG was 268 g pitch was 10º nose up and AoA was at Alpha Max 15º 22 24 Circumstances leading to the incident On application of takeoff thrust Eng  1 N2 Vibrations increased to 10 Units It is the maximum value that can be displayed on the engine SD page Though ECAM is inhibited during takeoff and till 1500 ft RA after takeoff N2 VIB would have been flashing during that period on the lower ECAM SD page During climb at about 4500 feet 1500 ft RA ENG1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution displayed Flight crew carried out QRH checklist as per the procedure The flight was continued though thrust on engine 1 was reduced sufficiently for the vibrations to reduce below the threshold of 5 Units The crew kept climbing to FL 140 whereas they could have leveled off for trouble shooting As soon as Eng 1 thrust was increased once again there was increase in the Eng N2 vibrations and stalling of Eng  1 Engine 1 thrust lever was set to idle while engine 2 thrust lever was left at CL detent In the event of one engine thrust lever at idle other engine thrust lever should be set to MCT The inaction of the crew induced an FMA display LVR MCT flashing caution which repeated every 5 seconds The flight crew at this stage should have moved the thrust levers to MCT but instead they disconnected the auto thrust which remained so till end of the flight The flight crew after discussion among themselves decided to return to Bangalore PAN PAN Call was given The reason mentioned was due technical Here correct reason ie engine problem could have been mentioned During descent engine 1 failed and was shutdown Engine 2 was reduced to idle till reaching 1000 ft RA Till that point the flight was on auto pilot with auto thrust OFF engine 2 was controlled manually Aural low energy SPEED SPEED SPEED warnings were triggered from 1000 ft and GLIDESLOPE warnings were triggered from 620 ft RA The aircraft was below the Glideslope by 14 dots Successive side stick pitch up inputs resulted in the pitch increasing up to 12º activating the Angle of Attack protection The 23 approach was continued despite being unstable and significantly below the Glideslope 27 dots below the Glideslope The unstable approach continued till touchdown All checklists were carried out but PM did not advise PF to go around The aircraft made a severe hard landing at the runway threshold while the PF was still commanding a full back stick The aircraft pitch was 10 nose up Alpha Prot was active and speed was 18 kts below VLS 3 CONCLUSIONS 31 Findings 311 Both operating flight crew were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight Their preflight Medical was valid 312 The aircraft had valid Certificate of AirworthinessAirworthiness Review Certificate and Certificate of Release to Service at the time of incident 313 The weather at the airport at the time of incident was fine and is not a contributory factor to the incident 314 Shortly after takeoff thrust was applied engine  1 vibrations increased to 10 UNITS the maximum value that can be displayed on the engine SD page The takeoff roll and flight was continued ENG1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution displayed at 1500 ft RA and approximately one minute later thrust on engine  1 was reduced to keep the vibrations below the threshold of 5 Units 315 Engine 1 thrust lever was set to idle while engine 2 thrust lever was left at CL detent This induced an FMA display LVR MCT flashing repeated every 5 seconds After about 88 seconds the flight crew disconnected auto thrust without making any changes to the thrust lever positions 316 An inflight turn back was initiated to the departure airport 317 During descent as engine 1 failed it was shutdown Thrust of engine  2 was reduced to idle 318 A manual approach was performed by the PF No AP ATHR below 1000 RA 24 319 SPEED SPEED SPEED and GLIDESLOPE warnings were triggered Successive side stick pitch up inputs resulted in the pitch increasing up to 12º activating the Angle of Attack protection 3110 The approach was unstable The aircraft went below the glidepath The speed was too low The aircraft was in a low energy state 3111 PF has not carried out Go Around nor the PM advised PF to go around 3112 The aircraft envelope protections limited the Angle of Attack from exceeding Alpha Max during the final approach and landing 3113 The aircraft performed a severe hard landing 268 g while the PF was still commanding a full back stick Airbus subsequently computed the g value as 325 and incident was assessed as severe hard landing 3114 At the time of touchdown the aircraft pitch was 10 nose up Alpha Prot was still active and the speed was 18 kts below VLS 3115 During rectification on ground oil chip was detected in MCD No 3 AGB  MGB 3116 The involved engine was replaced and on the recommendation of the supplier Safran both main landing gears were also replaced 32 CAUSE Unstabilised approach due to improper understanding of automation and thrust management after failure of one of the engines in flight resulted in severe hard landing and consequential damages 40 RECOMMENDATIONS For all Airlines flight crew 41 During simulator trainings normal flying or with failures emphasis should be laid on the use of appropriate levels of automation at all times There should be clear understanding of automation its appropriate level of selection and confirmation by assessing the aircraft response 25 42 To maintain handling skills adequate manual flying should be practiced on aircraft whenever conditions are favorable Prior appropriate briefing MUST be given to Pilot Monitoring for giving callouts of parameter deviations promptly so that smooth transition back to automation can be carried out if required 43 There should be strict compliance of stabilized approach by the flight crew PM should play an assertive role while calling out deviations and carry out a Go Around if required Date 04022020 Place New Delhi
