appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident The Aircraft held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of departure Airworthiness Directives  Service Bulletins were complied with Transit Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme were carried out as and when due 22 Circumstances Leading to the Incident EC ALTERNATOR Engine  1 Low Oil Pressure also triggered on ECAM The engine oil pressure was found reducing below 100 and was reduced to 2 within 05 seconds The Engine  1 power was crew carried out ECAM actions and subsequently carried out commanded IFSD of Engine  1 As the Engine parameters were abnormal and the engine  1 was Shut Down the crew Varanasi instructed aircraft to descend to lower level FL240 The aircraft was then changed over to ATC Lucknow After obtaining necessary clearances from ATC Lucknow the aircraft landed uneventfully with single engine at Lucknow Oil quantity of ENG  1 was found to be 2 quarts which was 20 quarts at the beginning of flight The consumption during the sector was abnormal Oil traces were found on exhaust nozzle tail cone drain mast and TR cowl area underneath drain mast Metal particles were observed on ENG  1 MGB chip collector The involved engine ENG  1 was removed from the aircraft for further detailed examination and aircraft released for further flight operations During Disassembly and Inspection of the engine carried out by OEM it was observed that the IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly fractured during engine operation It was 17 opined by the OEM that the resonance response of some IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assemblies to certain engine operating conditions can result in a high cycle fatigue fracture This fracture of IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly and consequent damages to other MGB components like PMA Starter Drive Deoiler Hydraulic pump etc led to improper scavenging and insufficient air sealing This resulted in various ECAM fault including Engine Oil low pressure and subsequently to engine failure and IFSD Commanded 23 Preventive Actions taken by OEM  Operator It was observed that the failure of MOPIDG gear was because of its resonance response to certain engine operating conditions which resulted in a high cycle fatigue fracture The OEM came up with an immediate as well as longterm corrective action plan to arrest such failing To eliminate the reoccurrence of IFSD events and obviate fracture of MOPIDG gear fracture Service Bulletin PW SB 7200 ine Gear shaft Integrated Drive Generator IDG Oil Pump Drive Assembly  Replace the IDG Oil Pump Drive Gear shaft

clearances from ATC Lucknow the aircraft landed uneventfully with single engine at Lucknow 6 During post flight inspection Oil quantity of Engine  1 was found to be 2 quarts which was 20 quarts at the beginning of flight The consumption during the sector was abnormal Oil traces were found on exhaust nozzle tail cone drain mast and TR cowl area underneath drain mast Metal particles were observed on Engine  1 MGB chip collector 7 On further inspection of AGBMGB Main Oil Pump MOP Integrated Drive Generator IDG Gear was found damaged 8 There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft 9 it was observed that the IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly fractured during engine operation 10 Based on analysis of earlier events it was opined by the OEM that the resonance response of some IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assemblies to certain engine operating conditions can result in a high cycle fatigue fracture 11 This fracture of IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly and consequent damages to other MGB components like PMA Starter Drive Deoiler Hydraulic pump etc led to improper scavenging and insufficient air sealing This resulted in various ECAM fault including Engine Oil low pressure and subsequently to engine failure and IFSD Commanded 12 To eliminate the reoccurrence of such events and PW SB 72000129 and Airbus SB 731136 were issued 13 Ms Go Air has carried out the task as per the above said SBs and as on date all their serviceable PW1127GJM engines are complied with these SBs No similar occurrence has been reported in India since the compliance of these SBs 19 32 Probable Cause of the Incident The IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly fractured during engine operation as its resonance response to certain engine operating conditions resulted in a high cycle fatigue fracture This fracture of IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly and consequent damages to other MGB components resulted in various ECAM fault including Engine Oil low pressure
