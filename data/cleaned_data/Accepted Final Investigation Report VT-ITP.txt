115 Survival Aspects The Incident was survivable 116 Test and Research 1161 Tear Down Reports from Pratt  Whitney As per agreement between Ms Indigo and OEM the damaged engine was replaced with a serviceable engine The damaged LH engine was sent to OEM after the incident The  Engine Disassembly and Inspection was carried out There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades preceding this incident The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue which had a developed corrective action in place No Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM on the Engine ESN P770516 During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair LPT Stage 3 and 1 were replaced with new as per the Shop Report made available by the OEM TEC was replaced with new The HPT and Combustor were upgraded to Block C configuration HPC Rear Hub and Stage 8 IBR were replaced The main gearbox was modified and EECPHMU software were upgraded as per applicable SBs 1162 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories Bengaluru AAIB India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187 P770530 and P770516 which had failed during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories NAL Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades ESN P770516 was fitted on VTITP at the time of incident NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB Following are the salient observations made in the failure report  Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at varying heights from the blade root platform Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge TE of the available part of the airfoil Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions 12 Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation In the fractured blades the fracture process in gammaphase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar separation in lamellar colonies Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction MoC showed that stage 3 LPT blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide TiAl an intermetallic material The MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52 Titanium Ti  43 Aluminium Al 4 Nobium Nb and 1 Molybdenum Mo The material did not have any metallurgical abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades TiAlbase intermetallic materials are in general brittle in nature having low fracture toughness Although the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with engineered microstructure the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance properties compared to the conventional Nickel Nibase superalloy that is generally used in this section of gas turbine engines The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae and isolated single phase gamma grains Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation the crack propagates instantaneously leading to fracture 117 Organizational and Management Information The aircraft VTITP is operated by Ms Indigo which is an Indian registered Scheduled airline and one of the launch customers for the Airbus A320 NEO aircraft fitted with PW1127GJM engines It operates scheduled flights to both domestic and international sectors It has got a fleet of Airbus A320A321 and ATR72 aircraft As of November 2020 Ms Indigo has a total fleet of 140 A320A321 NEO aircraft The operator

seal failure 01 LPT failure 15 N2 Vibration 01 MGB IDGLSOP gear failure 01 Table 4 Number of serious incidents corresponding to type of failures As per the above table it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents corresponds to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight As per agreement between Ms Indigo and OEM the damaged engines were replaced by serviceable engines All engines involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were quarantined after the occurrence and sent to OEM Pratt  Whitney facility in USA and Germany for repair Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical investigation as the events were similar to various prior occurrences and considered to be a known issue The Disassembly and Tear down report of all these Engine was shared with AAIB through Accredited Representative of NTSB 15 1182 Service Bulletin 72000111  Disk LPT 3rd Stage and Blade LPT 3rd Stage and ShroudSegment Ring 3rd Stage  Introduction of a New LPT 3rd Stage Blade which is more The SB was initially issued on 14th May 2019 thereafter Issue 2 was issued on 18th October 2019 and finally Issue 3 was issued on 28th May 2020 s fractured in service LPT 3rd stage blade made of a different mater The SB required that the LPT 3rd stage disk blades locking plates and shroud segments be replaced by the new set made of different material 1183 GuidelinesDeadline given  action taken by DGCA DGCA issued a deadline to Ms Indigo stating that each A320 NEO aircraft with PW1127GJM engine where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH must have at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith Further it stated that all the A320 NEO aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by 31st January 2020 On 25th November 2019 DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified LPT engines It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported Thereafter DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of Indigo However it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue to remain in force DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of replacement of unmodified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020 Later on 27th May 2020 DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127GJM engines 280 engines of Indigo had complied with SB 72000111 ie all its NEO fleet 140 aircraft were installed with LPT modified engines 16 119 Useful or Effective Investigation Techniques Nil 2 ANALYSIS 21 General Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident The Aircraft held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of departure Airworthiness Directives  Service Bulletins were complied with Transit Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all higher Insp guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme 22 Circumstances Leading to the Incident VTIPT was equipped with PW1127GJM engine Sr No 770516 This engine was fitted with premodified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and impact tolerance The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing and checklistprocedures for Engine Vibration and EGT overlimit and decided to divert to Delhi as the engine parameters were abnormal Crew informed ATC about diversion but no Emergency was declared by the crew After obtaining necessary clearances from ATC Delhi the aircraft landed safely at Delhi During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine LPT 3rd stage blades were found damaged Incident was one amongst series of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical Investigation into this case 23 LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action Based on the analysis by NAL Bengaluru to study Material of Construction MoC it was determined that the premodified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gammabased Titanium Aluminide TiAl which is in general brittle in nature having low fracture toughness 17 Although the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with engineered microstructure the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance properties It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL Bengaluru that LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187 770530 and 770516 had fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation the crack propagated instantaneously leading to fracture It is therefore evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades could not withstand possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously This led to engine high vibration and EGT overlimit Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified engines the airlines complied with SB 72000111 and all its A320 NEO fleet 140 aircraft were installed with LPT modified engines 3 CONCLUSION 31 Findings 1 The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness Certificate of Registration and the Certificate of Flight Release before operating the incident flight 2 Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight 3 There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft 4 During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine ie inlet area and exhaust area of Engine  1 Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged 5 The incident was similar to series of other events where LPT 3rd stage blades failed during operation The failure was considered to be a known issue by the OEM and no Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM 6 Failure Analysis of blades at NAL Bengaluru indicated that the LPT 3rd stage blades material had less crack growth resistance and damage tolerance which causes the crack to propagate instantaneously after initiation leading to fracture 7 Pratt  Whitney has issued SB 72000111 to Introduce of a new LPT 3rd stage blade made of a different material which is more resistant to impact damage The airline has incorporated the said SB in all its affected aircraft
